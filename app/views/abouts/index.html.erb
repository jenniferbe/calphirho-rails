		    	The <b>Alpha Theta</b> Chapter of Phi Sigma Rho was created by three lovely ladies: Annie Cheng (EECS '17), Anusha Jain (EECS '16), and Rachel Zhang (EECS '17). During their first year, it was important to them to find a support system with whom they could relate and would understood the academic vigor of Berkeley STEM. Unable to find an organization with the perfect balance of academic and social values, they decided to create their own. The result is a community—a sisterhood—with the purpose of bringing out each other's potential and providing academic and moral support.<br><br>

		    	In addition, this chapter has a commitment to empowerment and service. As an organization under the <b>Multi Cultural Greek Council</b>, we believe strive to foster values of mutual respect and unity.
